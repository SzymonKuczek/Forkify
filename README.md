# Forkify
A recipe app with many JavaScript features, made to train this language.

In this project I:
  - learned how to use API,
  - improved my usage of DOM skills,
  - worked with classes and arrays,
  - learned about architecture,
  - used localStorage,
  - used libraries,
  - learned how to plan a project
and much more!

This app was made along with Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.
